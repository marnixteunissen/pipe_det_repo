==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on March 22, 2021 at 12:10 PM GMT

It includes 124 images.
Pipe-ends are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 25 percent of the image
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
